## Authentication

![Add Zapier integration](https://cdn.zapier.com/storage/photos/5f1a0e1fc0eb5635bdf1a2983f31a9ba.png)

Most apps require authentication to access data via API calls, whether to let users access their personal data or enable access to restricted APIs. When building a Zapier integration, you define how the Zapier platform connects to your app and authenticates users.

Zapier supports five authentication schemes: Basic Auth, Session Auth, API Keys, OAuth v2, and Digest Auth. The default settings for each cover most applications’ authentication, or you can customize the authentication if your API has specific needs.

When users select your app’s integration inside a Zap, Zapier will use the authentication settings to request the user account, API key, or other details needed—or with session and OAuth authentication, Zapier will redirect users to your application where they can allow access to their accounts and your app can send credentials to Zapier.

Zapier supports:

- Basic Auth
- Session Auth
- API Keys
- OAuth v2
- Digest Auth
