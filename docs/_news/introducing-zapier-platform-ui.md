We’re excited to introduce a new edition of our web-based tool to integrate your API with Zapier. The new [Zapier Platform UI](https://zapier.com/app/developer/) is the easiest way to get started with a new Zapier integration. It's a ground-up rewrite with several key improvements:

- If you're new to Zapier, you can be productive right away with an intuitive UX that feels familiar to other API tools you use every day. 
- You can interactively test and preview your work without leaving the tool.
- API requests are highly configurable without coding, but you can still customize behavior with code if needed.
- The new Platform UI is aligned tightly with the Platform CLI tool which has a lot of benefits. You will be able to start new integration projects in the UI and make a seamless move to the CLI tool (coming soon). This tight alignment also enables us to more quickly introduce new platform features to all integrations, and more easily support our developer community.

And that's just the beginning! We’ve got a lot of great stuff coming throughout this year, including: 

- More super cool and helpful UX improvements in the works.
- Utilities to migrate integrations running on today’s Web Builder to the new Platform UI.
- A project exporter so you can switch over to the CLI any time.
- Better documentation and learning tools.

This is a brand new tool and as such, we’re bound to have a few hiccups. We want to hear about them and fix them fast, along with the new features we're adding over the coming months. Something unclear or confusing? We want to hear about that too!
