# Zap Creation API

The Zap Creation API provides the ability to create a Zap on behalf of a user. It allows your users to create new content in Zapier, as opposed to viewing existing content. 

It has more features but can be more complex to build with than using the plug-and-play [Full Zapier Experience](https://platform.zapier.com/embed/full-zapier-experience) or [Partner API](https://platform.zapier.com/embed/partner-api) methods.
