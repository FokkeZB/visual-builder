# Elements

## Introduction
Elements are prebuilt UI components that offer the quickest—and easiest—way to surface your Zapier integration, available app connections, popular Zap templates, and Zaps your users set up inside your product. 

Our Element generators let you customize the visual design and features of Zapier you want to include, and generate JavaScript code snippets that can be copied and pasted directly into your site. No programming experience is required!

## App Directory Element

A customized version of Zapier’s App Directory for users to search and build new Zaps with your Zapier integration. 

Open the [App Directory Element generator](https://zapier.com/partner/embed/app-directory/create) and type in your app's name. Using the sidebar panel in the tool, you can change the theme, add an introduction, include a search bar, display (or exclude) popular apps and categories, showcase your Zap templates, and more! When it's ready, you generate the correct codes and add them anywhere on your site.

## Zap Template Element

Zap templates are pre-made Zaps that help users discover popular use cases for automating their work. Each template features a specific use case and the apps (including yours!) needed for it to work.

Open the [Zap Template generator](https://zapier.com/partner/embed/zap-templates/create#type=popular) and type in your app's name. Using the sidebar panel in the tool, you can change the theme, display Zap Templates based on app pairings, display (or exclude) popular apps and categories, and more! When it's ready, you generate the correct codes and add them anywhere on your site. 

Want to embed specific Zap Templates instead? Simply select the [Custom selected](https://zapier.com/partner/embed/zap-templates/create#type=custom) tab where you can search and select one or multiple Zap Templates.

## Zap Manager Element

Our Zap Manager Element lets your users see the Zaps they've set up with your app directly inside your product. They can view their Zaps and see their status at a glance without having to go through Zapier first.

Access your integration in the [Developer Platform](https://developer.zapier.com/) to obtain your client ID, which you can use to generate your specific code. All you need to do is copy and paste! Then, once inside your product, your users will have the option to log into Zapier, where their Zaps will be displayed.
