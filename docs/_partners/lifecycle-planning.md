# 1. Plan Your Zapier Integration

No app can do everything on its own. The best apps are instead focused on their core features, then rely on integrations with dozens of other great apps to do the rest. That is what the Zapier platform enables. It brings the best of every app together.

A Zapier integration connects your app to 1,300+ of the best business and productivity apps so millions of Zapier users can add it to their workflows.

If you haven't yet, please read [How Zapier Works](https://zapier.com/help/how-zapier-works/) and set up a few Zaps to get a sense of the user experience.

Then, before you start building, think through how your Zapier integration will work, and plan out what triggers and actions to build. 

Building on the Zapier platform is different from other platforms. Instead of defining an entire app's end-to-end user experience, you're creating discrete triggers and actions .

However, it is similar in the sense that end user experience still matters **a lot**. Simply building triggers and actions from your public API endpoints isn't enough. You'll want to strongly consider workflows your app will support and what the user experience looks like while setting up a Zap with your app.

The most successful integrations on Zapier only have two or three triggers and actions to start. You can always add more over time as users request them. If you need help figuring out what might be useful to your users, you can browse the [App Directory](https://zapier.com/apps) for similar apps and see what triggers and actions are supported.
