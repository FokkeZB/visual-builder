# How to Maintain a Zapier Integration

Things change. Over time, you'll add new tools to your app, improve existing features, fix bugs, and continuously improve it. New features may grow it into a larger category, or make it more focused on a smaller niche. Its description will likely change, as may its logo or even name. The API may even change as your app matures.

Your Zapier integration needs to change, too. The best integrations are improved over time to improve their most popular use cases, remove bugs or confusing descriptions that tripped up users, and keep branding consistent with their core app.

Keep these guidelines in mind as you maintain your Zapier integration:

## How to Update App Branding in Zapier

The easiest thing to change is your app's name, description, logo, and category. You can update those anytime for any Zapier integration in the [Zapier Platform site](https://zapier.com/app/developer). Select your app integration, click the gear icon near its name, then update the app details as needed.

If you built your app using Zapier Platform CLI, you can also update the app name and description from the integration bundle's `package.json` file.

You may update app branding whenever needed without re-submitting your app to Zapier for approval. However, do always follow [Zapier's branding guidelines](https://platform.zapier.com/partners/planning-guide) whenever updating app branding.

## How to Monitor Feature Requests and Bugs

As people use your Zapier integration, they may encounter buggs and problems with your integration, or think of new ways they'd like to use your app with Zapier, and send them to the Zapier support team. We log those in Zapier's issue tracker, which you can see from the _Issues_ tab on your app's Developer Platform settings page.

Problems and issues with your integration, authentication, API calls, and more will be logged as `bug`, while new things users requires from your integration will be logged as `feature request`.

Whenever a new issue is added or updated, Zapier will log it in the _Issues_ tab of your app's Zapier Developer Platform settings page. Zapier will also send an email notification about the issue to your integration's original developer.

You can see additional details about the issue, along with the trigger or action it affects and how many users have encountered the issue, in Zapier's issue tracker. You can reply to the Zapier team about the issue there, or can simply reply to the notification email to add a response to the issue.

If you want others on your team to receive the issue notifications, or would like to route them to your support or developer team inbox, you can add additional notification email addresses from the bottom of the _Issues_ tab. You may also remove the original developer from the issue after you've added an additional contact.
