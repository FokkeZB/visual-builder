# Test Your Integration

![Testing Zapier Integration](https://cdn.zapier.com/storage/photos/bcad0a485f61f4acccf36cb19a0261ec.gif)

_Here's how your example GitHub integration looks inside Zapier_

You’ve already tested your GitHub authentication, trigger, and action in Zapier's integration visual builder. Now try using your GitHub integration in a Zap.

Open Zapier, click _[Make a Zap](https://zapier.com/app/editor/){:target="\_blank"}_, and select the _GitHub_ app with the `By Invite` tag to use your new integration. Try building Zaps using the trigger and action you created to test your Zapier integration. Want to do more with it? Go back to the Zapier visual builder and add more input fields to gather more data or create new triggers and actions to do more with GitHub.

You could also invite others to help test your app—something you won't need with your sample GitHub integration, but that will be helpful when you build a new integration with your API. Click the _Visibility_ tab, then copy the link on that page or enter a contact's email address to send them an invite to try your app. Once they accept, they'll see your integration inside their Zap editor, ready to use in any Zaps they build.

You’ve just built your first Zapier integration, and used it in your Zapier account! Congrats!

Take a break, then come back and give [Zapier Platform UI](https://zapier.com/app/developer/){:target="\_blank"} a try with your app. Connect your app's API, add the triggers and actions that will be most useful with your app, and build input forms to gather the data your app would need from users. If you get stuck, [Zapier's visual builder developer docs](https://platform.zapier.com/quickstart/introduction){:target="\_blank"} will help you learn more about the Zapier platform and build more detailed functionality into your integration—or [send the Zapier platform team feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfs0u5YppMGGwCuyVJJRdJuVcTEqOSV7tI5pzU4Szac2ii0Pg/viewform){:target="\_blank"} about any problems you encounter.

Happy building!
