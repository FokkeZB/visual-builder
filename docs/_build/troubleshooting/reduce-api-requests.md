# Reduce requests to your API

## Trigger/action runs in a Zap

### Constraint

Each time a Zap runs and your integration is invoked, it can mean multiple requests to your API endpoints, depending on what your trigger/action seeks to accomplish. This can mean hundreds of requests/hour for your polling triggers based on a [Zapier customer's plan](https://zapier.com/pricing), or thousands based on a Zap with an active REST Hook Trigger from another app and an action in your app.

For triggers/actions that include files in the output, each time a Zap step requests a file from your API, it will be accessed and downloaded from the relevant endpoint.

### Best practice

One way to reduce that API load is via the Zapier platform [dehydration feature](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform/blob/main/packages/cli/README.md#dehydration). By putting any secondary requests behind a dehydration pointer, Zapier will only make this request once, although it might see the same records again and again based on the Zapâ€™s polling cycle. 

For file outputs, implementing dehydration means the file will only be accessed and downloaded when a later Zap step asks for it.

To make this even more efficient, you can [stash the file](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform/blob/main/packages/cli/README.md#stashing-files) at Zapier. Rather than provide the file to the requesting step, Zapier will stash the file (under a dehydrated URL), so that only one request will ever be made for the file from your API.
