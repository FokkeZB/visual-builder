# Compute a field from the data of the Test API call

Zapier doesnâ€™t store the responses from the test API call for OAuth v2 and session authentication. Using computed fields, you can use data from a test API call later in your Zapier integration.

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge of working with APIs
- Understanding of computed field concept
- Familiarity with JavaScript

## Steps

1. Log into the [Platform UI](https://zapier.com/app/developer).
2. Select your **integration**. 
3. In the _Build_ section in the left sidebar, click your **authentication**.
    -  For Session authentication: 
        -  Click **Configure a Token Exchange Request**
        - Click **Switch to Code Mode**.
    -  For OAuth v2 authentication: 
        -  Click **Add OAuth v2 Endpoint Configuration**. 
        - Click **Switch to Code Mode**.
4. Add **custom JavaScript code** to instruct Zapier to call both the URLs necessary for the authorization process and your test API call.
5. Click **Save & Continue**.
6. The *Test Request* section remains unchanged.
7. Return  [computed fields](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform/blob/main/packages/cli/README.md#computed-fields) for data returned from either API call so you can reference those fields in subsequent steps as `bundle.authData.field` where `field` is the field's name from your test API call response.

Upon completion, you will be able to use data from a test API call as a computed field in later stages of your Zapier integration.
