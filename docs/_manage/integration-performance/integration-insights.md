# Integration insights definitions

Integration quality on Zapier boils down to two main pillars: **Health** and **Depth**.

**Health** - does the integration allow users to set up Zaps and keep them running reliably?
**Depth** - does the integration have all the functionality to allow users to automate what they want through their Zaps?

Definitions for each of the metrics provided in the integration dashboard below:


| **Metric**                  | Definition                                                                              | Filter by   |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **New users**               | Total number of new users using the integration over a selected period of time.<br><br> A new user = first time a user creates and activates a Zap with this integration. | Last 7 days<br>Last 30 days<br>Last 90 days |
| **Bugs & feature requests** | Total number of open bugs and feature requests for the integration.                    |              |
| **Daily active users**      | Number of users who had a Zap activated in a day.<br><br> Activated = Zap is on and successfully ran at least one task. | Last 7 days<br>Last 30 days<br>Last 90 days |
| **Monthly active users**    | Total number of users who had a Zap activated in a given month.<br><br> Activated = Zap is on and successfully ran at least one task.                         | By year                  |
| **Active Zaps**             | Total number of active Zaps over a selected period of time.<br><br> Active Zaps = number of Zaps currently on and using the integration.                  | Last 7 days<br>Last 30 days<br>Last 90 days |
| **Daily active Zaps**       | Number of active Zaps in a day.<br><br> Active Zaps = number of Zaps currently on and using the integration. | Last 7 days<br>Last 30 days<br>Last 90 days|
| **Active users retention**  | The percentage of active users retained each month.<br><br> Retention = users who have at least one successful task executed in a given month.                  |                              |
| **Zap activation rate by trigger**       | For a given trigger, the percentage of Zaps using the trigger and the rate of the ones that activated within 24 hours of creation. The higher the rate, the better the trigger is performing.<br><br> Activated = Zap is on and successfully ran at least one task. | Last 7 days<br>Last 30 days<br>Last 90 days|
| **Zap activation rate by action**       | For a given action, the percentage of Zaps using the action and the rate of the ones that activated within 24 hours of creation. The higher the rate, the better the action is performing.<br><br> Activated = Zap is on and successfully ran at least one task. | Last 7 days<br>Last 30 days<br>Last 90 days|
| **Usage by trigger**        | Number of current live Zaps (Zaps turned on), paused Zaps (Zaps turned off), and total Zaps for each trigger.  | By integration version                       |
| **Usage by action**         | Number of current live Zaps (Zaps turned on), paused Zaps (Zaps turned off), and total Zaps for each action.   | By integration version                       |


## Best practices

- Launching a co-marketing campaign or running ads? Track daily and monthly MAU over the launch period to track changes in usage.
- Noticing certain triggers and actions with higher activations? Create additional Zap Templates to expand usage further since you know they are popular functionality.
- Noticing certain triggers and actions with lower activation? Hop into the Zap Editor and test them out yourself. Are there any technical or usability issues you experience? How do other top apps in your category implement similar functionality?
