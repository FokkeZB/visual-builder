# Active users retention

At Zapier, churn means a user used your integration in their Zaps 29 - 56 days ago, but hasn’t run a successful task in one of those Zaps in the past 28 days. This user is considered to have churned from the integration. Maybe they switched to using a competing integration or their workflow had a more periodic or seasonal cadence.

But, it could also mean they got so frustrated with the experience of trying to get their Zap working and _keep_ it working successfully -  they turned it off, deleted it, and walked away.

Active users are the percentage of users who haven’t churned.

## Key Zapier insights

Lowered active user retention rates don’t necessarily mean poor integration health. Some apps lend themselves to use-cases with shorter lifespans than others. That said, spikes in churn rate not related to seasonal variations in usage could be indicators of a problem with something not functioning as expected.

Active user retention is not a leading indicator. In fact, it’s quite a lagging one that may only start indicating a problem up to 28 days after it has been an issue. That doesn’t deem it useless, we just have to know how to make full use of it.

## Best practices

Approaching active user retention with a long-term strategy can help maintain a consistently high level of retention:
 
- [Embed](https://platform.zapier.com/embed/overview) the Zapier experience with copy-and-paste and customizable code within your platform to provide automation value directly to users. Embeds have proven to [reduce churn](https://platform.zapier.com/partner_success_stories/all) on Partners’ platforms. Learn about embedding options in the [guide](https://learn.zapier.com/surface-your-zapier-integration-within-your-app).
- [Share use cases](https://platform.zapier.com/publish/partner-faq#tip-4-share-zapier-use-cases-in-your-onboarding) widely during your platform’s onboarding process. Having multiple Zaps using your integration increases stickiness of users not only to the Zapier integration, but also to your platform.
- Update the integration regularly with features as your platform evolves. [Invite stakeholders to your integration](https://platform.zapier.com/manage/invite-team-member) to give them admin or read-only access to insights, metrics, and feedback to prioritize and align improvements.
