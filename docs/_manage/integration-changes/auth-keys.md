# Change authentication field keys

## Change scenario

You want to change the key of one or more [authentication input fields](https://platform.zapier.com/build/basicauth#1-build-an-input-form) required when a user authenticates your app to Zapier.

## Impact to users

This is a **breaking change**.

Modifying the key of an existing authentication field constitutes a breaking change. Without adequate precautions, existing app connections may break as [migration](https://platform.zapier.com/manage/migrate) is not possible. Users will need to establish a new connection to your integration and manually refresh each of their Zaps.

## Best practices

We strongly encourage you to **avoid changing authentication field keys** whenever possible.

### Workaround

If your API endpoint requires a different property for authentication, think about adjusting the property key rather than amending the form field inputâ€™s key.
This modification must be made in each trigger, action, search request, as well as in the authentication.

>NOTE: Form field input keys do not need to match directly with the properties your API expects.

For example, let's say you have a form field input with the key `API-KEY`and are sending the field's value to your API using the same property name of `API-KEY`.

```
headers: {
  "API-KEY": bundle.authData.api_key; // original
}
```

Next, your API changes and expects the request property to be `X-API-KEY` instead. You can change the request property key (left) as needed. But still refer to the original form field input (right).

```
headers: {
  "X-API-KEY": bundle.authData.api_key; // new - request key and field key can differ
}
```
