# Add team members to your integration

You can add team members to your integration to collaborate, contribute, and get analytics data on the integration in the Zapier Platform. You can have up to 100 team members on an integration regardless of if it is a private or a public integration. Team members added to your Zapier integration can be assigned either of the following two roles:

- **Admin**: Admins have full access to build, manage, and edit your Zapier integration. Admin access is recommended for developers and others who directly contribute to building and maintaining your integration.

- **Collaborator**: Collaborators have view-only access to your Zapier integration (including integration details, history, and analytics). Collaborators are unable to edit but can view performance data, view the integration history, comment on feature requests and bugs, and access tools to embed Zapier integrations inside your UI to rack up user adoption. Collaborator access is recommended for product, leadership, partnership, marketing, and other teams that do not contribute directly to the creation and maintenance of the integration, but need to get data regarding the integration for analysis and record purposes.

## Adding team members

To add team members to your integration:
1. Log into the [Platform UI](https://zapier.com/app/developer).
2. Select your **integration**. 
3. In the _Manage_ section in the left sidebar, click on **Manage Team**.
4. Click on the **Invite Team Member** button.
5. Enter the team member's email address to be invited.
6. Select the **Team Member Role**.

> **Note**: Admins can invite both admins and collaborators while collaborators can only invite collaborators.

7. Add a **note** to the invitation. This information will be included in the invitation email.
8. Click the **Send Invite** button.

When you do this, an invitation email would be sent to the invitee, asking them to accept the invitation.

Once an invitee accepts the invite, they can access the integration through their own Zapier account. If the invitee does not have a Zapier account, accepting the invite would prompt them to sign up one first before they can access the integration.

## View and remove team members

You can view a list of invited team members (both those that have accepted the invites and those with pending invites) from the **Manage Team** page. An admin can also remove other team members from this page. However, please note that if you are removed as an Admin, you will only be able to regain Admin access if invited by an existing Admin.
