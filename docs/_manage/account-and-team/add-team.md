# Invite team members to your integration

You can add team members to your integration to collaborate, contribute, and view analytics data for your integration on the Developer Platform. Your integration team can have up to 100 team members, regardless of whether your integration is Private or Public. Team members added to your integration will be assigned one of the following roles:

- **Admin**: Admins are granted read and write access to the integration. This role is ideal for developers and individuals actively involved in building and maintaining the integration.

- **Collaborator**: Collaborators are granted read-only access to the integration. Collaborator access is recommended for product, leadership, partnership, marketing, and other teams seeking access to integration data for analysis and record-keeping without direct involvement in its creation and maintenance. While they cannot make direct changes to the integration, they can:

- View performance data
- View the integration history
- Review and comment on feature requests and bug reports
- Access tools to embed your integration throughout your site to drive user adoption

## Invite team members

To add team members to your integration, follow these steps:

1. Log into the [Developer Platform](https://zapier.com/app/developer)
2. Choose your integration
3. In the "Manage" section on the left sidebar, click "Manage Team”
4. Click “Invite Team Member”
5. Enter the email address of the team member that you want to invite
6. Select the role that you wish to assign to the team member
7. A note will be included in the invitation email. You can either use the default message provided, or customize it with your own text
8. Click “Send Invite”

> **Note**: Admins can invite both Admins and Collaborators, while Collaborators can only invite Collaborators.

Once you click "Send Invite", an email invitation will be sent to the invitee, requesting their acceptance. If the invitee does not already have a Zapier account associated with the invited email, they will need to create an account first. Upon accepting the invitation, they will gain access to the integration through their Zapier account on the Developer Platform.

## Self-serve Collaborator access

Depending on your [integration settings](https://cdn.zappy.app/b2637f3ad910c36c4e8c8224c349beee.png), users have the option to self-serve and join an integration team as Collaborators. This feature employs domain-name verification and is managed by integration Admins. Currently, this feature is only available for integrations listed in [Zapier's directory](https://zapier.com/apps).

## View and remove team members

You can view a list of invited team members (both accepted and pending invites) from the “Manage Team” page. Admins have the ability to remove team members (both other Admins and Collaborators) from this page. Collaborators can only remove other Collaborators. You can also remove yourself from the team, regardless of your role. It’s important to note that if you are removed as an Admin, you can regain Admin access only if invited by an existing Admin.
