# Create help documentation for your users

The Zapier team provide frontline support for your integration, and in order to provide the best experience for your users, help documentation about using your integration in Zaps is hosted in the [Zapier Help Center](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us). 

Ensure the Zapier Technical Writing team can create accurate documentation by filling out [this form](https://eu.jotform.com/form/202233475923352). 

Optionally include links out to documentation on your app's site to help customers find the information they are looking for.

Once submitted, it takes roughly 2 weeks to get help docs published in the Help Center.

As you maintain and add functionality to your integration, use the same form to submit updates at any time to the Technical Writing team.
